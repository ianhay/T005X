I wanted to see if there was still any truth in the old fashioned way of thinking that you shouldn't ask a lady how old she is.  I figured that the results from the table may show this.  Surprisingly there was the same number of males who did not provide their age as females (within 1 anyway), so maybe it could be deduced that females are just as happy to provide their age as males.  But then it became obvious that since there are more males enrolled than females, the percentage of females who did not provide their age is higher than the percentage of males who didn't provide it.  

About 5% of females declined to provide their age, while 3% of males declined.

I also noticed that more males made typos, based on the fact that more than one male put down their year of birth as 1897, and one even put down 2016!

As for plotting that information, I couldn't actually see a better way than by explaining in text, so I just plotted the ratio of male to female enrolments by year, as shown below.
